A project where user can login and post a message or share a post Something like twitter




To start the project you must go through all steps of requirements mentioned in requirements.txt file.




After that go to the directory in CMD/Terminal where you can see manage.py and  write the following command:-	

		python3 manage.py runserver
		or 
		python manage.py runserver





That's it now you can see a locahost link similar to 127.0.0.1 click on the link to open or copy and paste in your favourite browser

If you can't see any link then you have skipped any of the command from requirements
